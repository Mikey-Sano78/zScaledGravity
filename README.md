# zScaledGravity
A unified framework replacing dark matter with scale-dependent gravity (G(z) = G₀e^{μz}, μ=0.1).
# z-Scaled Gravity: Dark Matter is an Artifact  
## Abstract  
This paper proposes a unified framework where gravity strengthens exponentially at cosmic scales (G(z) = G₀e^{μz}, μ=0.1), eliminating dark matter.
